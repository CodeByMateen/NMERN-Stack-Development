we can use html code below function, above return as the file is a jsx so it'll be a valid syntax e.g. 

function Video({title,channel="CodeByMateen",views,time}) {

  // See this, it's valid!
  let channelJSX = <div className="channel">{channel}</div>

  return (
	{channelJSX}
  );
}

but this is not a good way

--> you can't apply if else condition inside return as the conditions are not returning something
--> if you want to do conditions, it's better to use ternary operator
 and while putting ternary, if you dont' want to insert any value for else case, you can simply use null e.g. condition?result:null

In our mini project in chapter 2, we created 3 thumbnail of videos, now we want to add verified tick to channels and we'll do it through conditional rendering
