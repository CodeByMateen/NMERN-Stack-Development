-> in code section 0, we see the buttons, on clicking them, their status -> playing, paused is working but ui has no effect. Also, the counter is also not incrementing in UI. This effect can be shown through useState hook on -> code 01 - useState Hook
-> useStates Hook remembers the old value

.... let's see the following code:

function Counter(){
    const [number, setNumber] = useState(0)

    function handleClick(e){
        e.stopPropagation()
        setNumber(number+1)
        console.log(number)
    }

    return(
        <>
        <h1>{number}</h1>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Add</button>
        </>   
    );
}

here, the ui will show incremented number but in console, the increment change will not be shown insant. e.g. if number is 1 and we click on Add, the ui will show 2 but in console it's 1 as useState itself called and do the storing functinality.

    function handleClick(e){
        e.stopPropagation()
        setNumber(number+1)
        setNumber(number+1)
        setNumber(number+1)
        setNumber(number+1)
        console.log(number)
    }

if we do this, and click on Add button, the increment change will be occured once not 4X
we can also consider this as when we click on like button of post, the post is liked.
Still if we want to do this, we can use updater like this:

    function handleClick(e){
        e.stopPropagation()
        setNumber(number=>number+1)
        setNumber(number=>number+1)
        setNumber(number=>number+1)
        setNumber(number=>number+1)
        console.log(number)
    }

the updater is creating a queue like structure of record.
